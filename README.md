Features
Add, edit, and view member details.
Enroll members in classes and assign workout plans based on fitness levels.
Restrict members from enrolling in plans for which they donâ€™t meet the fitness level requirement.
Prevent overlapping class schedules.
Manage emergency contacts for members.
Prerequisites
Node.js installed.
PostgreSQL database set up.
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AdityaMahajan1614/Gym-Management-System.git
cd Gym-Management-System
2. Set Up Database

Open queries.sql.

Run the commands in queries.sql in your PostgreSQL database to create tables, constraints, and sample records:

sql
Copy code
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f queries.sql
3. Configure the Backend
In the server.js file, make sure the PostgreSQL connection settings match your environment. Update these settings as needed:

javascript
Copy code
const pool = new Pool({
    user: 'your_username',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'your_database',
    password: 'your_password',
    port: 5432,
});
4. Run the Backend
Start the backend server by running:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
The backend will be available at http://localhost:3001.

5. Running the Frontend
Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.

Navigate to the frontend folder (if it's a separate folder) and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.
